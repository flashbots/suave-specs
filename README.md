This repository hosts the current SUAVE specifications.

Discussions about design rationale and proposed changes can be brought up and discussed on the [Flashbots forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/). Solidified, agreed-upon changes to the spec can be made through pull requests.

<div class="warning">

‚ö†Ô∏è The SUAVE protocol is still in a state where [the code](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth) is the most up-to-date protocol spec. The goal of these notes is to gradually evolve into an implementation agnostic specification. ‚ö†Ô∏è

# Specs

Specifications for the SUAVE protocol are currently organized by testnet during early protocol development. Several testnets might be developed in parallel.

## In-development Specifications

# Contributing

You are welcome to open PRs and issues. We invite you to discuss your ideas in the [Flashbots Forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/) for greater visibility and to avoid doing work that is unlikely to be widely accepted and merged into the core specs.

<div class="hideInDocs">

For creating tables of contents, we use the ["Markdown All in One" VS code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one). This extension comes with a lot of keyboard shortcuts, which may override the ones you are already using. You can disable keyboard shortcuts for this extension by going to "Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts" (cmd+K cmd+S) and searching for `markdown.ext` (see [#22](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-specs/pull/22) for more details).

However, we don't need the ToCs and some other content (like this paragraph) rendered in the documentation frontend. Therefore, please add the `<div class="hideInDocs"></div>` to any content that should not appear in the FE.
