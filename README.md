This repository hosts the current SUAVE specifications.

Discussions about design rationale and proposed changes can be brought up and discussed on the [Flashbots forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/). Solidified, agreed-upon changes to the spec can be made through pull requests.

<div class="wipSection">

⚠️ The SUAVE protocol is still in a state where [the code](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth) is the most up-to-date protocol spec. The goal of these notes is to gradually evolve into an implementation agnostic specification. ⚠️

# Specs

Specifications for the SUAVE protocol are currently organized by testnet during early protocol development. Several testnets might be developed in parallel.

# Contributing

You are welcome to open PRs and issues. We invite you to discuss your ideas in the [Flashbots Forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/) for greater visibility and to avoid doing work that is unlikely to be widely accepted and merged into the core specs.

<div class="hideInDocs">

For creating tables of contents, we use the [xavierguarch.auto-markdown-toc VS code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xavierguarch.auto-markdown-toc) and recommend the following user setting: `"markdown-toc.depthFrom": 2`.

However, we don't need the ToCs and some other content (like this paragraph) rendered in the documentation frontend. Therefore, please add the `<div class="hideInDocs"></div>` to any content that should not appear in the FE.
