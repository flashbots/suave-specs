This repository hosts the current SUAVE specifications.

Discussions about design rationale and proposed changes can be brought up and discussed on the [Flashbots forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/). Solidified, agreed-upon changes to the spec can be made through pull requests.

⚠️ The SUAVE protocol is still in a state where [the code](https://github.com/flashbots/) is the most up-to-date protocol spec, but this repository aims to be a starting places to gradually evolve into an implementation agnostic specification.⚠️

# Specs

Specifications for the SUAVE protocol can be found in the [`specs`](specs/) subdirectory. Specs are currently organized by testnet during early protocol development.Some testnets will be developed in parallel.

* For creating tables of contents, we use the [xavierguarch.auto-markdown-toc VS code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xavierguarch.auto-markdown-toc) and recommend the following user setting: `"markdown-toc.depthFrom": 2`. However, we don't need these ToCs rendered in the documentation frontend. Therefore, please add the `<div class="toc"></div>` to any content that should not appear in the FE.
