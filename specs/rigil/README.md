This repository hosts the current SUAVE Rigil testnet specifications and design docs.

<div class="warning">

‚ö†Ô∏è The SUAVE protocol is still in a state where [the code](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth) is the most up-to-date protocol spec. The goal of these notes is to gradually evolve into an implementation agnostic specification. ‚ö†Ô∏è

# About Suave

SUAVE - Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression - is a platform for building MEV applications such as OFAs and block builders in a decentralized and private way.

# Rigil Design Goals

1. **Market for Mechanisms** - create a robust environment which offers basic programmable privacy and useful MEV precompiles.
2. **Permissionless SUApp Deployment & Interaction** - Enable permissionless innovation by allowing anyone to deploy and interact with contracts.
3. **SGX UX Closeness** - Get as close to SGX user experience as possible and minimize breaking changes down the road.

## Design Decisions

Here is a list of design decisions and tradeoffs:

- Decision 1: **Weak DA Layer Guarantees**
    - Reason: [Compute Output Validity and Heterogenous DA](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/suave-ensuring-output-validity-and-heterogenous-da/2184) is an active open question, which whether or not answered does not drastically impact UX on Rigil Testnet.
- Decision 2: **Proposer Centralization**
    - Reason: [SUAVE consensus](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/suave-consensus/2152) is an active open question, which whether or not answered does not drastically impact UX on Rigil Testnet.
- Decision 3: **No SGX Nodes (yet)**
    - Reason: Research continues on the best wa to implement this, which will be detailed in a later spec.

# Rigil Overview

## Users

The Rigil testnet is initially focused on a specific set of actors:

1. **Developers** - create smart contracts on SUAVE Chain that define rules for MEV applications like orderflow auctions and block building. Smart contracts deployed by developers can call special *precompiles* to request confidential computation.
2.  **Users** - send requests/transactions to SUAVE. Such transaction can include confidential data.
3. **Proposers/Sequencer** - extend another blockchain with a new block.
4. **Builders** - can be implemented as smart contracts inside Suave. In the Rigil Tesnet, Suave submits bundles to several external builders.

## Architecture

SUAVE Computors house all components necessary to perform confidential compute and are the main protocol actor in the SUAVE protocol. Below is a high level architectural overview followed by a brief descriptions of the main components.

![Rigil architecture](/assets/rigil-architecture.svg)

- **Confidential Compute Request (CCR) [**[üîóspec](./suave-chain.md#confidential-compute-request)**]**: A user request to Suave that contains:
    1. a wrapped transaction
    2. confidential inputs, and
    3. a list of programs (contracts) (‚Üê list of Exec nodes) allowed to operate on confidential inputs.
- **Computor[**[üîóspec](./computor.md)**]**: accepts and processes confidential compute requests and maintains the SUAVE chain; the logical unit of the SUAVE network and main protocol actor.
- **Confidential Data Store (CDS) [**[üîóspec](./confidential-data-store.md)**]**: stores confidential data from MEV applications (L1 transactions, EIP 712 signed messages, userOps, privateKeys(?), etc).
- **SUAVE Chain [**[üîóspec](./suave-chain.md)**]**: a fork of Ethereum designed for usage alongside credible off-chain execution in MEV use cases. Running Clique PoA consensus for the Rigil Testnet.
- **MEVM [**[üîóspec](./mevm.md)**]**: modified EVM with MEV-specific precompiles that allow developers to define orderflow auctions and builder rules as smart contracts written in Solidity.
- **Precompiles [**[üîóspec](./precompiles.md)**]:** purpose-built functions with extended capabilities that can be called from Builder Solidity


## Transaction-flow

The SUAVE-enabled node and the MEVM support multiple new data types, which are all specified in the [SUAVE Chain spec](./suave-chain.md#custom-types).

The diagram below showcases how these different types interact to enable confidential computation on SUAVE computors.

![Rigil transaction flow](/assets/rigil-tx-flow.svg)
[ TODO : add numbers/steps for tx flow]

Transaction Flow:
1. User sends a Confidential Compute Request to the RPC - Confidential Compute Requests are made up of two components, Compute Transaction and Confidential Inputs. The Compute request will reference data inside of the Confidential Inputs that the MEVM is able to use during computation.
2. Once the RPC receives the Confidential Compute Request, it will extract the confidential inputs and send them to the confidential data store. It will then send the Compute Request to the MEVM to process.
3. Confidential Compute Phase - During this phase the MEVM will process the compute transaction similar to an EVM transaction except it will also have access to the confidential inputs. After doing the initial computation with the confidential data, it will then grab the results and information from the Compute Transaction and put them into their final home a SUAVE transaction.
4. Block Inclusion - Once the SUAVE transaction has been created it will then quickly be included in a block by a SUAVE proposer.


## OFA Example

If we consider a specific use case, like an order flow auction, the high-level series of steps taken to complete the auction can represented as below:

![OFA example flow](/assets/OFA-example-flow.svg)
[TODO : add numbers/steps for tx flow. And change `newBid` maybe]

1. The user sends a Confidential Compute Request interacting with a SUAVapp by calling it's `newBid`


Conceptually, such auction mechanisms can be split into seven steps:

1. User -> RPC
2. RPC -> MEVM
3. MEVM -> Confidential compute result to SUAVE Chain
4. Searcher, listening to events on SUAVE -> RPC
5. RPC -> MEVM
6. MEVM -> internal simulation (based on contract logic)
7. MEVM -> send bundle to builder via precompile
